- default to "unknown" by "none" (the test was not done/not mentioned)

- if the report level label is in the trumping list - give it the appropriate rank

- if it is not (e.g. "Positive by None") and there is a test result (i.e. positive or negative) 
  then default the method to the most common method (and give it the appropriate rank)
